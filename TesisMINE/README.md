**Analysis of the behavior of students in MOOC's content of Mathematics in primary** is a D3.js visualization, on its fifth version [v5], to get to support some needs that has the team of "Una Empresa Docente" from the Faculty of Education of Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, Colombia. It provides statistics, through developed visualizations,about the levels at which students complete the course activities, the number of students participating and the number of attempts they make to complete an evaluation. This information allows this team to identify the modules, subjects, and activities that are not completed by the students, the frequency of participation and the difficulty of the evaluations regarding the number of attempts to finalize it successfully, principally.

The last actualization of the current visualization was made on: 03/12/2018

In order to get the information presented in the resulting page the following process was done:

Coursera provides a copy of the database, for investigation of the course administrators, this copy contains database creation scripts and contains the data that will be populated in the tables, the database must be loaded in an engine of Postgres database on the local server. The ua_v_item_curso view was created in the database engine to identify the relationships between the modules, sessions and items. For the identification of active students, the ua_v_estudiantes_actual view was created, this to facilitate the creation of the respective consultations as an input to the visualization presented
